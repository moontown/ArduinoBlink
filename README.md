# ArduinoBlink
Easy Arduino blink project

*****I don't take responsibility for anything in this project that may cause damage to your hardware*****
*****The responsibility is in your hands*****

This little tutorial will help you out with the well recognized BLINK-project with an Arduino Uno
For code and more information, please read the attached files.

Preperation:
* Unplug your Arduino from your computer.
* Make sure you use a anti-static wristband or similar

What you'll need:
* Arduino Computer Software (You can find the software at "https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software")
* 1pcs Arduino UNO R3 or similar
* 1pcs Arduino USB Cable
* 1pcs Anti-static wristband
* 1pcs LED (Most of the Arduino UNO's have a small LED installed just next to PIN 13 in case you may not have a LED)

Step 1:
* Take your Anti-static wristband on and make sure you connect it somewhere to ground.
* (This may otherwise cause damage to your Arduino.

Step 2:
* Open the Arduino Software on your computer.
 
Step 3:
* Connect the LED into your Arduino by placing the long LED "leg" into PIN 13
* and the shorter "leg" into PIN GND(Ground) next to it.

Step 4:
* Connect your Arduino into your computer via USB

Step 5:
* See the code file for more information.
* I've left comments next to the code to make sure you undestand what everything in the code does.

Good luck!
